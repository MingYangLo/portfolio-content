		<h1>Experiences</h1>
		
		<h2 id="workExperiences"><br>Work Experiences</h2>
		<p>
			Till now, I have had three internship experiences. 
			The most recent is a software algorithms internship. I developed a graphical user interface for processing over 20+ medical image algorithms. 
			The differences in the algorithms' results were also compared for an ongoing platform transformation. 
			Another internship I did is participating in the development of a sensor-based intelligent diagnosis maintenance system. What the system does is analyze the data extracted from vibration sensors and determine if there are malfunctions or hazards in the manufacturing/assembly process. 
			My first internship was to analyze the testing data of electrical and pneumatic hand-tools. 
			After the analysis, we would brainstorm and think of solutions based on mechanical knowledge and experiences. Then, the tool's components would be modified and its performance would therefore be improved. 
			During this internship period, I gain a great experience and perspective on how manufacturing company performs by working with multiple departments including quality assurance, assembly, design & development, and validation.

		<h2 id="learnings"><br>Free Time Learnings</h2>
		<p>
			As a human with curiosity, it is such a privilege to live in an era where learning new knowledge is so simple and easy, all a person needs to do is to connect to the internet. 
			Youtube is one of the great sources for learning, some of my favorite channels are: 3Blue1Brown, Branch Education, Real Engineering, SciShow, Veritasium, and Numberphile. 
			3Blue1Brown is my favorite channel. I love how the host uses animation and clear expression to explain math concepts and sometimes brings up inspiring mathematical ideas. 
			My second favorite channel is Branch Education. The host explains about how electronic devices work, such as in a recent episode it talked how SpaceX's Starlink operates. 
			It is sometimes fascinating to realize that some concepts/knowledge I learned from the past could be implemented in real-world applications in a way I never thought of before.
