		<p>
			Till now, I have three internship experiences.
			The most recent is a software algorithms internship. I developed a graphical user interface for processing over 20+ medical image algorithms.
			The differences in the algorithms' results are also compared for an ongoing platform transformation.
			Another internship I did is participating in the development of a sensor-based intelligent diagnosis maintenance system.
			What the system does is analyze the data extracted from vibration sensors and determine if there are malfunction or hazard in the manufacturing/assembly process.
			My first internship was to analyze the testing data of electrical and pneumatic hand-tools. After the analyzing, the tools' performance would be improved through modifying components.
			During this internship period, I gain a great experience and perspective on how manufacuring company performs by working with multiple departments including quality assurance, assembly, design & development, and validation.

		<p>
			As a human with curiosity, it's good that I live in an era that the only limitation for learning new knowledges is to have internet connection.
			Youtube is a great sourse for learning, some of my favorite channels are:
			3Blue1Brown, Real Engineering, Primer, SciShow, Veritasium, and Numberphile
			Add few descriptions for above channels.
			Besides Youtube channels, I also acquire the latest knowledge and skills on Udemy & Coursera.
			Add some thoughts of each above courses.
