		<p>
			Yosemite National Park is in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is known for its waterfalls and many other natural landscapes. 
			The displayed images are taken during my trip visiting Yosemite during the summer of 2022. 
			Yosemite Falls was surprisingly packed with people, and if zoom in close enough, you could also see there were people climbing up the on the right side of the fall. 
			Tenaya Lake and Tunnel View are cozy places where I felt relaxed seeing the view and feeling the breeze. 
			The tree at Olmsted Point is on a big rock, I have to say that it took me quite some time to climb up with slippery shoes. 
			Last but not least, Mono Lake is the first saline soda lake I have ever seen in my life.

		<h2 id='NorthernMichigan'>Northern Michigan</h2>
		<p>
			Northern Michigan is known for its lake views and many other natural landscapes. 
			The displayed images were taken during my trip visiting some parts of Northern Michigan during the late summer of 2022. 
			Being one of the large cities of Northern Michigan, Traverse City does have a lot to offer. It has amazing restaurants and several wineries. 
			We went to Chateau Chantal Winery and Inn, which has a spectacular view and lovely wine selections. 
			We also went on an exciting buggy ride at Silver Lake state park, my friends and I had a blast there. 
			Our stay at a lodge was delightful, it has astonishing morning and sunset lake views of Lake Michell.
