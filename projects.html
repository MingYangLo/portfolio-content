		<p>
			The main objective is to estimate an object's 3D position from two cameras using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) with sequential measurement update.

			Extended Kalman filter vs Kalman filter?
			Kalman filter is an approach based on recursice Bayesian filtering where the noise in the system is assumed Gaussian.
			Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is an extension of KT for non-linear systems where non-linearity are approxiamted using the first or second order derivative. 
			The idea of ​​the particle filter (PF) is based on Monte Carlo methods, which use particle sets to represent probabilities and can be used in any form of state space model. 
			The core idea is to express its distribution by extracting random state particles from the posterior probability.
			The result was to able to reduced estimated position error by 2.1% and 7.3% respectively by using batch measurement update.

		<h2 id="PointCloud">Point Cloud Processing: Point Cloud Registration Enhancement</h2>
		<p>

		<p>
			Point clouds are often aligned with 3D models or with other point clouds, a process known as pointset registration. 
			The aim is to find a rigid transformation among these point clouds.
			Iterative closest point (ICP) is a powerful algorithm employed by a robot to accomplish these tasks by estimating pose variation between two successive data frames. 
			However, the drawback of ICP is that it does not take geometric information into account and is sensitive to initial correspondences of the two point clouds.
			This project solves the problems mentioned above by implementing another algorithm - Point Feature Histogram (PFH), which provides a better solution to registration since it incorporates more informative geometric features when matching the correspondence. 
			To be more specific, the key component in PFH is to estimate surface normal and curvature for a point with its k-nearest neighbor and further formulate associate local features. 
			These features enable us to find more the accuracy during the correspondence calculation process.
			As for the result, we decreased 22% of total time through extracting key features with Intrinsic Shape Signature in a dense point cloud.
